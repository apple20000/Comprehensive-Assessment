This dataset had to deal with bodyfat and the goal was to predict it based on different fratures  and if body fat can be estumated based on
different measurable characteristics. 

The dataset was loaded and cleaned to also include standardard values. This model was captured using linear regression and the model performace was evaluated using MSE whihc can be a great tool to tell you how close your predictions are to the actual values.
This model had a MSE of 18.76 whihc is a moderate level of prediction error. Other models can potentially get the MSE to be at a lower prediction error.
